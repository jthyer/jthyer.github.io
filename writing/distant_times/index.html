      <h2 id="yesea-spy" class="toc-heading">The Yesea Spy</h2> <a href="#header">↑</a>
      <div class="userstuff">
         <p>The stern ship captain slammed his hand on the meeting table.</p>
         <p>"There’s no other explanation for how the Yesea keep defeating us in battle. There’s a spy on the ship, and they’re relaying our tactics to the enemy. They could be in this very room."</p>
         <p>Everyone eyed each other suspiciously. I made a show of squinting at everyone else as well. The grizzled captain, who looked like the bearded star of some ancient earth naval warfare video log. The bespectacled technician, whose hyperdrive fixes had "suspiciously" failed during the last star battle, leading to the loss of several cruisers. The vice admiral, whose tactical blunders had led to more losses elsewhere. Myself, a battle commander fresh out of school with once-in-a-generation grades in simulated battles. And a dozen other key generals and figures in the Urta fleet.</p>
         <p>Someone here was a spy, clearly, and that was why they’d had so many catastrophic losses.</p>
         <p>Idiots. I was the only Yesea spy on this ship, and I’d done nothing to make them lose those battles. They were all just incompetent, and instead of blaming themselves they were getting paranoid. And when it came to my true mission, that paranoia could be very inconvenient.</p>
         <p>"We should transfer the captured Yesea princess to another fleet," said one of the anonymous incompetent generals. "It’s possible she has something to do with this."</p>
         <p>No, she didn’t, you bureaucratic buffoons!</p>
         <p>"I agree. I can have her transported first thing tomorrow," said the captain.</p>
         <p>Shit! I needed to say something. But what could I say that wouldn’t arouse suspicion?</p>
         <p>The moment passed. The rest of them agreed with moving the princess.</p>
         <p>I’d been laying plans for months. I wanted to get her off the ship and back to Yesea, <i>without</i> compromising my position at the top of the Urta military.</p>
         <p>And now I had to get her out of here tonight. There was no other option. I had to go all in on this if I wanted to rescue the princess.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>The soldier saluted me. "Hail, Lieutenant!"</p>
         <p>I saluted back. Then I shoved a laser dagger into his chest. The wound cauterized instantly – his diaphragm was too mangled for him to make any sounds as he collapsed to the ground.</p>
         <p>I used my credentials to open one of the empty cells and pushed the corpse into it. Solid ionized steel hid the body from any casual observers.</p>
         <p>I looked through the small sight hole into the princess’s cell. She was asleep on her cot, looking homely in the plain prisoner’s uniform.</p>
         <p>The generals thought I was here to ruin their battle plans. They were doing just fine at that themselves. I didn’t need to risk any external communications when I knew our commander would see through their transparent strategies.</p>
         <p>My only mission now was saving the princess.</p>
         <p>"Wake up," I barked.</p>
         <p>She sat up instantly and shriveled away from the door. Fear was plain on her face.</p>
         <p>I should’ve done this sooner. I’d seen first hand how callous and brutal Urta soldiers could be. How much abuse had my princess suffered in the past months?</p>
         <p>But this was no time for pleasantries. We had to move quickly.</p>
         <p>"Get under the cot, as far from the door as you can manage. Then close your eyes."</p>
         <p>Something in the urgency of my tone got through to her, and she obeyed instantly.</p>
         <p>I set the dimmer on my net-shades to almost black, and notched the laser dagger to its highest setting. It burned bright white, even through the shades. I quickly plunged it into the lock on her door.</p>
         <p>I held my breath, waiting to see if the alarm would go off, or if my hacking earlier had been successful. Silence, except for the sound of burning steel. Excellent. I carved the knife around the lock. Right as I’d formed a full circle around it, the dagger burned out.</p>
         <p>I tossed the now-useless knife aside. I felt vulnerable now – I’d only managed to smuggle a single one onto the ship with me. I only had my blaster now, and I didn’t feel comfortable relying on Urta tech for defense.</p>
         <p>I pushed the lock out into the princess’s cell. The door opened easily.</p>
         <p>"I’m here to rescue you. C’mon, we don’t have much time."</p>
         <p>The princess took my outstretched hand. Pale grey Yesea hair framed her worried features. An unfamiliar warmth coursed through my chest. I couldn’t fail. I had to save her.</p>
         <p>We ran down the hallway, my gun drawn. I hadn’t had much time to plan our escape. The escape pods were fifteen minutes away, if we ran. Fourteen minutes. Twelve minutes. Nine minutes away. The princess stopped, out of breath. I stopped and bit down on my tongue, trying not to pull her along. Then we kept running. Eight minutes. Six minutes. Four. Three.</p>
         <p>We turned a corner, and found ourselves staring down six blasters.</p>
         <p>"So, it <i>was</i> you," said a gruff voice. The captain stood behind the six soldiers.</p>
         <p>I didn’t hesitate. I shoved the princess to the ground, and fired my blaster into the mass of soldiers.</p>
         <p>The gun didn’t go off. The captain chuckled.</p>
         <p>"A remote kill switch?" I asked. "The admiral refused when you asked to include those on our blasters. She said the Yesea could hack them and use them to their advantage."</p>
         <p>"I spoke with her privately and managed to get them installed on a few particularly suspicious recruits." The captain grinned. "Goodbye, Lieutenant."</p>
         <p>"Paranoid lunatic," I spat.</p>
         <p>The soldiers fired. But I was in the air, above the one closest to me. I landed on him with a crash and cracked his head against the wall. I seized his blaster, and shot through the throats of two more soldiers.</p>
         <p>Two blaster bolts tore through me. One through the shoulder, one through my right lung. Those wouldn’t heal easily, not even with nano-tech. Don’t think about it. Three more shots, and the rest of the soldiers were down.</p>
         <p>A white blade carved through my wrist. My hand, and the blaster, fell to the ground.</p>
         <p>The captain was wielding a laser dagger. A now-crazed grin was carved on his face. "I may hate the Yesea, but I recognize good tech."</p>
         <p>He shoved the dagger into my stomach. Too low, below the diaphragm. Amateur. If I could still breathe, I could still fight.</p>
         <p>The princess was huddling off to the side, with her eyes closed.</p>
         <p>I twisted his wrist with my remaining hand until he let go, dimming my shades with a mental command. I pulled the dagger out, and flashed it to the highest setting. The captain screamed as white starlight blinded him. Then I pushed the blade into his heart, and he stopped screaming.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>I pulled open the escape pod door. "C’mon princess, get in. You’ll reach Yesea-controlled space in three hours. After that, activate the distress beacon."</p>
         <p>"What about you?" she asked in a whisper. It was the first time she’d spoken to me.</p>
         <p>"I’ll be fine. I’m getting into the next pod."</p>
         <p>She nodded, and belted herself in. "Thank you."</p>
         <p>I nodded back, smiling. The hatch closed. I heard the pod fire off into space. Soon, she'd be far from anywhere the Urta could reach.</p>
         <p>I slumped to the floor as soldiers poured into the room.</p>
         <p>"Where’s the captain? Lieutenant, what happened to you?"</p>
         <p>"You idiot, the lieutenant was the spy! The Yesea princess was on that pod!"</p>
         <p>"What? How do we stop it?"</p>
         <p>"I don’t know! Only the captain can order us to scramble the jets!"</p>
         <p>My vision started to fade as a confused-looking soldier slapped ion cuffs on my wrists. Then he realized they wouldn't work with one of my hands gone. He scratched his head and looked around, waiting for orders.</p>
         <p>I thanked the stars for the incompetence of the Urta fleet. I closed my eyes. Be safe, my princess. Soon, you’d finally be home again.</p>

      <h2 id="a-wake" class="toc-heading">A Wake</h2> <a href="#header">↑</a>
      <div class="userstuff">
         <p>It’s the same wheel my mother used to spin thread. It whirls ahead of me, just a few feet away. There’s no thread attached — the point of the distaff is as naked as I am, and much sharper. I step towards it, and collide with the still air between us. No matter how hard I push, I can’t move the invisible barrier between me and the wheel.</p>
         <p>If the barrier is glass, it doesn’t smudge. It's as clear as air. The floor is jet black, featureless, and expands in all directions. The sky is a cool dark empty blue. It bathes everything in an eerie indistinct glow, enough light to see and no more. Mist hovers and dances in the air in all directions. The only feature in sight besides the mist is the wheel.</p>
         <p>“She was such a sweet girl,” an empty voice murmurs from no direction in particular. “After what happened to her mother and then her father, it must have been too much for her to take.” I recognize the voice, though I can’t remember who it belongs to. I know it’s the voice of someone who often pretended to care about me.</p>
         <p>I can’t remember much of anything outside the maze, except that the wheel looks just like my mother’s. I remember her face, her delicate hands spinning thread with it. I remember her smile, the way she patiently taught me to spin thread myself. I have to reach that wheel.</p>
         <p>I backtrack, doing my best to avoid slamming into more of the “glass” walls. I’ve learned my way around the maze pretty well. I’ve closely explored the whole area near the wheel. I don’t have any breadcrumbs; instead, I pluck long blonde hairs from my head and leave them on the ground as markers. There’s no wind here, so the hairs aren’t in danger of blowing away. I kink the tip of each hair and make sure to point it in the same direction as each other hair. I’ve decided, arbitrarily, that this is north, and I want to keep track of where I’m facing at all times.</p>
         <p>I’ve confirmed this path leads to a dead end, so as I go back, I tie the hairs on the path into little loops, making sure to point each loop “north.” More and more hairs I come across are tied into loops now. I ignore those paths, and make my way back to one full of unlooped hairs I passed on my way here.</p>
         <p>“Good night, dear sister.” “We’ll miss you ever so much.” Two voices whisper around me. Unidentified revulsion courses through my veins. Whoever those voices belong to, I know I must have despised them.</p>
         <p>I don’t know how long I’ve been here. I don’t need to sleep, eat, or drink. I haven’t needed a toilet. It’s a shame — if I had waste to work with, I could make more legible floor markers than my hairs. But I’ve tried, and nothing comes out no matter what. I can't cry or spit or vomit either.</p>
         <p>The problem with the hairs is that I can only see them from a few feet away. If I had larger markers, I’d be able to see through the glass walls around me much farther, see which areas I’ve explored.</p>
         <p>Hope swells in my chest, in spite of myself. I’ve approached the wheel from south, east, and west, from northeast, southeast, northwest, southwest. All seven directions were blocked by glass walls. I’ve double, triple, quadruple checked each path. I’m absolutely certain the entrance must be to the north. After all, what’s the point of a maze with no solution?</p>
         <p>My heart beats hard in my chest, my only measure of time passing in this desolate place. I make my way back around to the north. I couldn’t say how many miles, dozens of miles I walk. It’s a circuitous path, but I can remember it. The wheel completely leaves my sight for long stretches, enveloped by darkness and the mist.</p>
         <p>I see it. Just ahead. I’d ventured outside the paths I’d explored before; I was laying down fresh hairs, kinked ends pointing north. The wheel was in the exact opposite direction. I approached it from the only possible open angle. I got closer and closer, finding routes around each wall in my path. I keep laying down hairs the entire time. I don’t lose my patience. I don’t make a mistake.</p>
         <p>The wheel spins just ahead of me. Just a few feet ahead. This is it. This has to be it.</p>
         <p>My breath hitches as I slowly reach my hand forward.</p>
         <p>My fingers touch smooth, cold glass.</p>
         <p>No. No no no no. I check all around the wall for openings; I detect none. Of course not — the walls are always perfect, no holes, stretching higher, far higher than I can climb by lifting myself up between two of them.</p>
         <p>I back-track. I must have made a mistake. I check each and every path. South, east, west. Southeast, northeast, southwest, northwest. And finally north again. My legs ache from the long walk with no break, but I have to know. I have to know I didn’t make a mistake.</p>
         <p>I didn’t. My notes were all perfect. Not a hair out of place. I press my hands against the glass, just feet away from my goal. My face contorts and heaves, but of course no tears come.</p>
         <p>The wheel is surrounded by walls on all sides. There’s no solution to the maze.</p>
         <p>“Goodbye, dear, dead daughter.” A sneering voice echoes around me. The voice lowers to a whisper, meant just for me. “We’ll take good care of your inheritance. Rest well, forever and ever.”</p>
         <p>White hot liquid fury bubbles up in me. I know that voice. I hate that voice.</p>
         <p>I realize I’m running out of time. If I don’t get out of here soon, I never will. I have to reach the wheel.</p>
         <p>There’s a long straight stretch before the north wall. I go back as far as I can, twenty or thirty feet. Then I run towards the wheel. Just before I reach it, I brace my shoulder in a tackle. It collides with the wall. I hear a low metallic ringing as pain shoots through my shoulder and the rest of my body.</p>
         <p>I go back again. I run, twenty, thirty feet, straight at the wall, not caring if I mess up my hairs. Pain shoots through me again. I hear the ringing. Nothing else happens.</p>
         <p>I go back again. And again. And again. Something snaps in my right arm as I collide with the wall. Broken bone cuts through my skin. I fall to the ground, screaming from the pain. The ringing from the walls cuts through the sound and reverberates in my gut.</p>
         <p>After a while, I get back up. I note absent-mindledly the lack of blood coming from my wound. It makes sense — if the labyrinth doesn't allow me to cry, why should it allow me to bleed?</p>
         <p>I change angles and fling the left side of my body against the wall. I do it again and again. The walls keep ringing. I feel the ache of wide colorless bruises across my shoulder, but with no broken bones I can still stand the pain.</p>
         <p>I understand now. The labyrinth is a distraction. I’m going to get out of here. I’m going to get out of here and kill that woman.</p>
         <p>I fling my broken body against the wall, finally hearing bone snap in my left side too. I collapse in a heap.</p>
         <p>I don't know what else to do.</p>
         <p>I can't beat the labyrinth. For the thousandth time I wish desperately that I could cry.</p>
         <p>Then I realize the walls aren't ringing.  They're making a new sound, a splintering not unlike the ones my bones made before.</p>
         <p>I look up, and I see it. There's a crack in the wall. To my shock, it's spreading. It propagates upward, further than I can see. It spreads through all the walls around me too.</p>
         <p>Before I process what's happening, the walls fracture, split apart, and fall to the floor, in a great cacophony of tinkling glass.</p>
         <p>There’s nothing between me and my goal now. I tear myself up off the ground and finally cross the last few feet to the spinning wheel.</p>
         <p>I know exactly what to do. I press the tip of my index finger to the point of the distaff.</p>
         <p>My eyes open. I see blue sky and green trees and the confused and furious face of my stepmother. I remember everything — her greed, her cruelty, and the spell she cast on me after I discovered she’d poisoned my father.</p>
         <p>I smile. Then I scramble out of the coffin. My stepmother is too confused to know what to do. She barely fights as I shove her to the ground and climb on top of her.</p>
         <p>My stepsisters scream and weep as I squeeze her throat. Unlike my body in the illusion, my real arms aren't broken. I push every ounce of my recaptured strength into my fingers, desperate to destroy this woman who'd hurt me in ways that could never be undone.</p>
         <p>It takes a half-dozen of the men attending the lovingly furnished funeral to tear me away from her. She makes great heaving coughs on the ground in front of us. I hadn't managed to kill her, regrettably.</p>
         <p>That's okay though. She had one chance to bury me and the truth. I'll make sure she never gets another one.</p>
         <p>My stepmother's crying. She's quieter than my stepsisters, but the sight is no less repulsive. I'm crying too — I savor the sensation, the liquid running down my face, the taste of salt, the snot building in my sinuses. I stare at my stepmother and sisters, and I grin, because unlike them I know how precious tears can be.</p>

         <p>His mouth trailed up my thigh, my side, my back. I felt his hot breath on my neck, my cheek. He nibbled my ear gently.</p>
         <p>“You’re not going to leave me again,” he whispered. “Right, gorgeous?”</p>
         <p>I let out a small gasp as his hand trailed up my side. He was hard against me.</p>
         <p>“I won’t let you, you know.” He bit down on my shoulder. “I’ll kill you if you leave me again.”</p>
         <p>I hated Sven when he got like this. I hated him most of the time, really.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>“Alex, I told you last time I wrote you up you can’t be late anymore,” said Dennis. “How do you think I feel when my boss comes by and you’re not here? It makes me look bad.”</p>
         <p>I’d just walked in the door, and my hangover was still killing me. I scratched my head, mumbling. “I’m sorry.”</p>
         <p>“You said you were sorry the last three times,” he sighed. “Look, Alex. This isn’t working out.”</p>
         <p>The next few minutes passed in a blank haze. Nothing felt quite real. Then I was standing outside the cafe, and I didn’t have a job anymore.</p>
         <p>Still numb, I walked back to the train station. I flashed my card on the reader and made my way through the turnstile and up the stairs to the landing. The brown line north was running smoothly now — they’d cleared the obstruction on the tracks that delayed me getting to the cafe. I thought dimly about making a new obstruction on the tracks. Then I got on the southbound train towards home.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>A woman sobbed in the next room. My roommate’s bedroom was right next to mine, and the insulation was non-existent. Whenever he and his girlfriend had an argument, I got to listen to every excruciating detail. My noise-cancelling headphones broke last week, and I didn’t have the money to buy new ones. All I could do was blast metal on my earbuds, almost loud enough to hurt. That drowned out some of it, but when they got heated even that wasn’t enough.</p>
         <p>I tried my best to sleep. I finally turned off the music. The arguing had stopped, and the sobs were quiet now. I could hear my roommate cooing softly to her now. Then springs started squeaking.</p>
         <p>I listened to the building moans, and thought of Sven, despite myself. I knew I shouldn’t — I knew if I started dwelling on him again it wouldn’t end well. My hand traced down my front, across my thighs, and finally gripped my cock. I listened to the moans and imagined I was the one moaning, imagined Sven cooing in my ear.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>“We’re sorry. We just don’t think your qualifications line up with the position.”</p>
         <p>That was what I imagined the man in the suit saying. It was what the rejection email in three weeks would say. But right then he was just shaking my hand and thanking me for the interview. I thanked him in turn and was guided out of the tall building.</p>
         <p>I didn’t know why I thought applying for tech jobs again was the right call. I hadn’t had any luck the last three times, and my IT certifications weren’t getting any less ancient.</p>
         <p>I thought about getting a taco bowl on the way back. I looked at the prices on the menu outside the restaurant. I thought better of the impulse and left for the subway station.</p>
         <p>My card beeped red on the turnstile. I rubbed my temples, looked around, and hopped over it. No one yelled at me this time, thankfully.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>I got the rejection email only a week later. I added it to the job hunt folder in my email with the other two dozen rejections. I took a deep breath and checked the bank account app on my phone. I was close to the limit on my credit card.</p>
         <p>I took a deep breath, opened a job hunt site, and looked around for openings at cafes and grocery stores. This stuff suited me fine anyway. I should’ve started here from the beginning.</p>
         <p>I tried to ignore the squeaks and moans coming from the room over, overpowering the prog rock album I had booming in my ears.</p>
         <p>I felt arms wrap around me, and heard Sven’s voice in my ears. It would be so easy. I knew he’d respond within minutes of texting him. Within hours, I’d be in his bed.</p>
         <p>I jacked off listening to my roommates fuck. After coming, I was able to delete the text I’d drafted in my messages app. That was close.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>“What the hell are you talking about, man?”</p>
         <p>I’d asked my roommate if he could cover my chunk of the rent, that I’d pay him back in two weeks after my dad got his paycheck and could afford to send me some cash.</p>
         <p>“You’ve been applying for like three months, dude. Shouldn’t you like, get unemployment or something?”</p>
         <p>Was that an option? I’d looked up unemployment before; the process seemed so annoying I didn’t bother.</p>
         <p>My roommate couldn’t help. I wound up talking to the landlord directly on the phone. He was more overtly annoyed, but ultimately agreed to take my share in two weeks sharp. I thanked him profusely and hung up.</p>
         <p>I spent the rest of the night downing shots of my roommate’s bad vodka and jacking off.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>The next morning, I saw a reply to a text I’d apparently sent the night before. It was Sven.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>Bad incense crowded in my nostrils. The room smelled just as rancid as it had the last time, and the time before that, and the time before that. I knew I was too drunk for this, but I didn’t care, and Sven certainly didn’t.</p>
         <p>His cock slid into me, and all other thoughts exited my mind.</p>
         <p>“I’ll kill you if you leave me again, beautiful.”</p>
         <p>I hated him. Maybe that’s why his cock felt so good. I savored the feeling of fullness I’d been craving for far too long.</p>
         <p>“I love you, you know. I love you so, so much.”</p>
         <p>I didn’t reply.</p>

         <p>I gave Eric a hug. “Don’t worry, it’s going to be fine,” I said. I didn’t believe it, but I hoped Eric did.</p>
         <p>I sat back down in my cheap metal seat next to the other performers. Eric gave me a strained smile, then walked up the shaky steps to the rented stage platform. He set a small portable stereo at the front of the stage. Then he stood under the spotlight and looked out into the audience.</p>
         <p>He wore a white unitard with matching white leggings. His toned, strong body always surprised me when I saw him in his ballet outfit. He looked so different from the Eric I knew in middle school, just a few years ago.</p>
         <p>I glanced behind me. The audience sat in more folding chairs behind us, all the way back to other end of the gym. The room was too dark for me to make them out clearly. I hoped my dad — or Eric’s older brother for that matter — had made it, although I knew they probably hadn’t.</p>
         <p>The two judges sat behind a narrow table between us and the stage.</p>
         <p>“Name?” demanded the older judge, the school principal.</p>
         <p>“Eric Mason, sir,” replied Eric, stiffly.</p>
         <p>“What <i>talent</i> will you be demonstrating for us, Eric Mason?” said the younger judge, Mr. Woodsmith. He scribbled something on the notepad in front of him.</p>
         <p>“Ballet.”</p>
         <p>“Are there a lot of male dancers at your school?” asked Mr. Woodsmith. His voice sneered. I wondered if he always sounded like that, or if it just came out when he wanted to make children feel small.</p>
         <p>Mr. Woodsmith was the “out-of-state consultant” the school had hired to revamp the annual talent show. He was the one who’d insisted on adding a judging panel, so the school could assess the “objective merit” of the students’ performances.</p>
         <p>It was a part of the broader reorganization efforts to align the school with the governor’s new orders. School should prepare us for the <i>real world</i>. We couldn’t expect <i>participation trophies</i> — we would only be rewarded if we demonstrated real worth. Mr. Woodsmith and the governor both loved complaining about “participation trophies,” even though no one I knew had ever gotten one before.</p>
         <p>Basically, if we sucked ass, the judges would tell us. And they wouldn’t be gentle about it.</p>
         <p>“Just me and J— me and one other performer, sir,” replied Eric. “He’s already performed tonight. I’m the last one.”</p>
         <p>My dance sucked ass, according to Mr. Woodsmith.</p>
         <p>After a nod from the judges, Eric started the stereo. The opening notes of <i>Dance of the Blessed Spirits</i> rang out through the gym. Eric took a deep breath, and started to dance.</p>
         <p>He was beautiful, of course. He was way, way better than me.</p>
         <p>I smiled to myself, remembering when I’d baited him a month ago by asking whether he’d do a Tchaikovsky like me. He’d bitten his lip, trying not to launch into his normal diatribe about <i>The Nutcracker</i> and <i>Swan Lake’s</i> continued over-exposure.</p>
         <p>The Gluck excerpt he performed centered around Orpheus and Eurydice, the Greek tragedy about a man who’d traveled to the underworld to rescue his lost love. Eric was so animated when he’d told me about the story behind the dance, how he wanted to convey its feeling through his movements.</p>
         <p>I didn’t get it at the time. But after all his practice, I could see it now. His expression, the restrained, pained movements of his sweat-glistened body. Another performer sitting next to me, who’d been crying ever since Mr. Woodsmith had mocked her poetry, looked up from the spot on the floor she’d been staring at. She watched Eric, almost as raptly as me.</p>
         <p>Eric had reached the next level, the one I was still miles away from. He’d trained his technique so effectively that he could move his body the way he wanted to without thinking about it. That freed up his mind to focus on artistic expression. He was so good at dancing he could afford to worry about telling a story.</p>
         <p>The other performer next to me, across Eric’s empty seat, put down his phone and watched attentively.</p>
         <p>I knew Eric wasn’t <i>great</i>, not in the real sense. We’d seen professional performers; we knew how far we were from <i>great</i>. But for someone who’d started ballet just a few years ago, Eric was fantastic. Any real dancer or director would know his potential just looking at him. He wasn’t yet, but he could <i>be</i> great if he put his mind to it, if he got the support he needed.</p>
         <p>Unfortunately, support was hard to come by in this school. In this whole state, for that matter.</p>
         <p>The song ended. Eric held his final, perfect pose. He embodied the pain of Orpheus, who’d looked back at Eurydice after he’d stepped out of the underworld, only to see her vanish before his eyes.</p>
         <p>There was no applause. Applause was strictly forbidden by Mr. Woodsmith, unless he gave his express approval. Only quality performances were to be rewarded.</p>
         <p>“I just don’t get why your kids are wasting their time with all this queer shit,” said Mr. Woodsmith to the principal next to him.</p>
         <p>The principal was silent, as usual.</p>
         <p>“Why don’t you play basketball or something, Eric? You’ve got the height for it.”</p>
         <p>Mr. Woodsmith gave a wave of his hand. Eric was dismissed. There would be no applause.</p>

      <div class="userstuff">
         <p>Dry dirt cracked underfoot as Ina and the captain walked through the narrow, ancient hallway. Torchlight bounced around the walls, revealing faded plaster paintings of long dead myths. Ina crinkled her nose. The stench of thousand-year-old stale air was getting to her.</p>
         <p>“Do you know how much further it is?” Ina asked.</p>
         <p>“I still don’t, Ina,” the captain said dryly. “Same as the last time you asked.”</p>
         <p>Ina pinched her nose and breathed through her mouth. It was no good. She could still taste the smell. It was almost repulsive enough to discourage her growling stomach. She wished again she'd thought to pack a few snacks.</p>
         <p>The hallway took a steep slope downward, again. It had leveled out a while ago after the last incline. They must be deep into the ruins under Frieturn at this point. Ina tried not to think about how long it would take to get out.</p>
         <p>The tall frame of the captain stopped suddenly in front of her. Ina nearly bumped into him.</p>
         <p>“What’s wrong?” she asked.</p>
         <p>“Run,” he replied quickly. He grabbed her arm and dashed forward.</p>
         <p>She felt it too, then. There was a presence behind them, a little ways down the hall. She didn’t want to know what would happen if it caught up to them.</p>
         <p>The captain pushed forward. He’d let go of her arm once she’d gotten running. They ran until Ina’s lungs burned, until her sword grew heavy at her side.</p>
         <p>Then she saw it – a large door at the end of the hall. The captain yanked the heavy stone door open, pushed Ina inside, leapt in, and closed off the passage behind them.</p>
         <p>Ina waited to hear something behind the door. But there was only silence.</p>
         <p>“What was that?” Ina said.</p>
         <p>“Humans aren’t supposed to be here,” he said, almost to himself. He gently pressed a hand to the door. Then he turned and started walking away.</p>
         <p>He didn’t elaborate, and Ina didn’t press further.</p>
         <p>It was a short walk. They reached another door, this one much larger and more impressive. The edges were full of inlet gems that sparkled in the torchlight, untouched by tomb robbers.</p>
         <p>Even though Ina didn't know the specifics of their mission, why they were in these ruins. But she had the sense they were doing something terribly important. </p>
         <p>She touched the captain’s arm. “Sir, I just wanted to say…”</p>
         <p>Her voice choked. The captain turned to her, silent, his eyes as unreadable as always.</p>
         <p>She pushed the rest out. “Thank you. For taking a chance on me. I’m glad to be part of the corps.”</p>
         <p>The captain stared. Then, miraculously, he actually smiled at her.</p>
         <p>“You’ve done well, Ina. We’re lucky to have you.” He turned and pushed open the door. “And you are absolutely essential to this mission.”</p>
         <p>Ina didn’t know what he meant by that. But she trusted the captain, and she followed him through the passage.</p>
         <p>The door swung shut behind them. They must have been on an incline for the door to close on its own like that. Ina looked around the cavernous room, her eyes wide. Thousands of jewels embedded in the walls glimmered in the light.</p>
         <p>There was a stone platform in the center of the room, raised about a foot off the ground. In the platform’s center was a pedestal. On it sat a bleached white steer’s skull. Two large rubies filled the skull's eyeholes.</p>
         <p>“Ina,” said the captain. “Give me your sword.”</p>
         <p>Ina blinked, turning from the skull. “...Sir?”</p>
         <p>“That’s an order.”</p>
         <p>Ina hesitated for only a second. Then she took her sword and sheath from her belt and held it out to the captain.</p>
         <p>He drew the blade, leaving her holding the sheath. He eyed it in the light of the torch he carried in his other hand. “Perfectly maintained as always. You really were something special.”</p>
         <p>There was a strange look in his eyes. It was sad, and something else too. Ina didn’t like it.</p>
         <p>The captain smiled. Then he pointed her sword at her. “Ina. Do exactly as I tell you from now. Understood?”</p>
         <p>Ina nodded. Her throat was dry. What was going on?</p>
         <p>“Stand on the platform, before the skull. Look into its eyes. Don’t look away, no matter what.”</p>
         <p>Ina obeyed. The flames of the torch danced in the skull’s red ruby sockets. The acrid smell of the ruins suddenly assaulted her again.</p>
         <p>“State your name and rank."</p>
         <p>Ina clutched the empty sheath in her hands tightly. "Warrant Officer Ina Ryder."</p>
         <p>"What are your dreams, Ina?"</p>
         <p>“What?” Ina looked back toward the captain.</p>
         <p>“I said look at the skull!” he barked, suddenly furious. She’d never heard the captain like this before.</p>
         <p>Ina turned back to the skull, tears welling in her eyes. </p>
         <p>"What are your dreams?" he demanded again.</p>
         <p>"I... I want to keep climbing the ranks of the corps," she said truthfully. "I want to be a captain someday, like you."</p>
         <p>The flames glittered in the eyes of the skull.</p>
         <p>"Keep going," barked the captain.</p>
         <p>"I want to protect people." Ina bit her lip. "I want to send money back to my sister, so she can pay off her debts and save up to move here with me."</p>
         <p>"Is that all? Don't you have any selfish dreams?"</p>
         <p>Ina strained, trying to think of something she wanted just for her. Only one thing came to mind.</p>
         <p>"I want to eat more good food. <i>Really</i> good food. Like the dinner you treated me and Gracie to when we got promoted. You can't get food like that outside the city."</p>
         <p>The skull's gemstone eyes shined a deep bright crimson. Ina wanted nothing more than to look away. Tears fell from her face to the floor.</p>
         <p>Shadows danced in the corners of Ina's vision. She felt bolted in place, unable to do anything but stare into the rubies' light. The light pulled her inward, like it was trying to envelop her.</p>
         <p>A deep voice echoed around the whole room at once. “I see you've brought me another one, Zachary.”</p>
         <p>“The same as usual,” replied the captain. “I expect the same bargain. Five years.”</p>
         <p>“I can guarantee your kingdom’s harvest for four years.” Ina heard a smile in the disembodied voice. The skull was still. “The last one was prettier.”</p>
         <p>“Fine,” said the captain.</p>
         <p>Ina was frozen in place. She stared straight at the shining rubies. But in the shadows of her peripheral vision, the walls seemed to be shimmering, changing. Brown stone turned reddish pink. She couldn’t look directly to see, but the gems surrounding them felt more like thousands of bright white eyes, staring directly at her.</p>
         <p>“Captain, what’s happening?” her voice croaked out.</p>
         <p>The ground under Ina's boots turned from hard rock to something else. It felt like she stood on raw steak. She suddenly sank a foot into the raised platform. Something wet wrapped itself around her shins. She struggled to keep her balance.</p>
         <p>“Oh,” the voice boomed in her ears. “What a fine taste. Humble wishes go down smoother than portentous ones. Perhaps I’ll give you five years after all, Zachary.”</p>
         <p>“That would be very generous of you," replied the captain.</p>
         <p>Ina sank another foot into the ground, then another. A thousand tongues ran up and down her trousers. Saliva seeped through the fabric, soaking her legs and thighs and waist. She still couldn’t tear her eyes away from the ruby-filled sockets.</p>
         <p>“Yes, five years. That’s a fitting payment for a morsel of this quality.”</p>
         <p>The floor pulled Ina another foot deeper and pressed against her body from all sides. Iron-smelling liquid soaked into her tunic. The sheath in her hands snapped in two, then disappeared from her grip.</p>
         <p>She was low enough now that she couldn’t see the rubies on the pedestal anymore. She could finally look down and see blood-red wet meat swallowing her chest.</p>
         <p>She twisted her neck harshly against the meat and barely managed to catch a glimpse of the captain. He stared flatly at her, his expression blank and unreadable.</p>
         <p>“Captain, help—” Ina's sentence cut off as the floor crushed the air from her lungs. She sank another foot. Meat surrounded her neck, strangling her.</p>
         <p>Then she sank again, and the flesh closed around her, and both her captain and the light from the thousand glistening eyes in the walls vanished.</p>

      <h2 id="what-i-liked-about-him" class="toc-heading">What I Liked About Him</h2> <a href="#header">↑</a>
      <div class="userstuff">
         <p>I didn’t remember much about the day we left. I was young. I remembered the long countdown. I remembered how my body pressed into the chair when it reached zero, how my bones turned to jello and I started to cry.</p>
         <p>I remembered my dad sitting next to me. He stared straight ahead, unblinking, his knuckles white as he gripped the seat handles. He’d told me we were saying goodbye to everyone, that we’d be safe where we were going. His voice had that stiffness it always had when he was trying to sound certain for his daughter.</p>
         <p>And I remembered Rowan. He was a boy around my age. He didn’t cry when we lifted off. When I looked over at him, he smiled, and said something I couldn’t hear over the roar of the rocket. It comforted me anyway.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>Rowan and I watched from up in the tall oak’s branches as the adults scrambled and bickered around the river edge. The grass and dirt had turned to thick mud around their shoes. The river was flooding, though not at a particularly worrying pace.</p>
         <p>“It’s a problem with the computer,” said Rowan. “They think it’s something to do with plumbing, but it’s not.”</p>
         <p>“How do you know?” I asked. I resituated myself on the large branch so I could sit more comfortably. I leaned against Rowan, still looking at the adults with clipboards as their arguing escalated to yelling.</p>
         <p>“Erica and Peter do the plumbing for the whole station. They know exactly what they’re doing. They just checked on the river’s pipes last week. We were here — I even pointed them out to you.”</p>
         <p>I leaned against Rowan, closing my eyes. “So, why do you think it’s the computer?”</p>
         <p>“Everything is the computer’s fault around here. It’s Terrence. He wasn’t good with code in the first place, and he’s overworked on top of that. If he taught someone else how it all worked, he could have some help. But he insists on doing everything himself.”</p>
         <p>“Hm,” I murmured. Rowan was warm. I liked leaning against him like this, up in the trees, away from everyone. I was comfy existing right here, but Rowan’s mind was always everywhere on the station at once.</p>
         <p>I didn’t mind that, though. It was one of the things I liked about him.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>Rowan and I sat close to each other in the dark corner of the supply hold. It was one of the many spots we’d found where we could be together without anyone bothering us. No teachers lectured us on the importance of our studies. How, as some of the last surviving humans, it was vital we learn the endless histories of a now-dead planet we felt no real connection to.</p>
         <p>Rowan pulled his lips from mine. “Did you like that?” he asked. His face had been warm against mine. “That’s how they did it in that old record we watched together.”</p>
         <p>My face was hot too. Over the last few years the comfort I felt with Rowan had taken on a strange edge to it. I was more conscious of his body, the muscles in his legs, under his shirt. I could tell he felt the same way around me.</p>
         <p>That edge got stronger after we watched that record, the one Rowan had found by hacking into Terrence’s restricted archive. We only watched a little before getting scared and stopping. But we both wanted to try what we’d seen, even if we didn’t know exactly how. I was the one who’d suggested we experiment.</p>
         <p>There was a loud clang from somewhere else in the supply hold. We waited to see if someone would turn on the lights. No one came — it had just been a box flopping over, falling prey to some movement of the station the inertial dampeners couldn’t quite erase.</p>
         <p>“It feels nice,” I said. “Let’s do it again.”</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>It was years of kissing, touching, petting before we dared experiment further. For one thing, it was getting harder to steal away together as our studies got more rigorous. More things kept breaking on the ship everyday, and the adults took their stresses out on “too-unserious” teenage students that “didn’t understand their responsibilities” to the station.</p>
         <p>But we still found moments, evenings together. We’d both been surgically fitted with birth control mechanisms a few years ago, so we knew we didn’t have any surprises to worry about. As usual, I’d been the one to push us forward.</p>
         <p>“I just don’t know,” he said. “Are you sure we’re ready?”</p>
         <p>I pulled him into a kiss, felt him stiffen against me. He wanted this just as much as I did.</p>
         <p>He pulled open my shirt, felt me in his hands as he had a dozen times before. After building me up for an agonizingly long time, he pulled down his pants, then mine. He got ready to enter me.</p>
         <p>“I love you, Rowan.”</p>
         <p>He flashed the same warm comforting smile at me he had ten years ago, when we were both loaded together on a rocket and fired into the stars.</p>
         <p>A bright red light flashed in the janitorial closet. An ear-splitting siren wailed.</p>
         <p>Rowan pulled away from me. Deep disappointment pulsed through my body as we both got dressed in a hurry.</p>
         <p>We ran out into the hall. Our feet splashed in three inches of water that covered the whole passage floor.</p>
         <p>“Dammit. The station’s flooding, at least this part of it. Where’s the nearest terminal?”</p>
         <p>I pointed left — if we ran, we could reach a network access point in five minutes or so. But why did Rowan want access to the network?</p>
         <p>We dashed down the passage together. I struggled to keep up with Rowan. We reached the terminal in three minutes.</p>
         <p>Adults crowded around the computer.</p>
         <p>“Where’s Terrence?” Rowan asked.</p>
         <p>The adults didn’t look at him. One replied, “He’s out cold in the sick bay. Drank too much again, the lush.”</p>
         <p>The adult pecking away at the keyboard swore. “I can’t get in. He has the infrastructure settings locked down tight.” The adult stood up from the terminal, punched the nearest metal wall, and swore from the pain. Nobody else approached the terminal.</p>
         <p>“What do we do?” I asked quietly.</p>
         <p>Rowan bit his thumbnail.</p>
         <p>Then he jumped at the terminal and started typing on the keyboard. An adult told him to get back. Rowan just stared at him for a moment, rolled his eyes, and went back to typing. No one tried to pull him away.</p>
         <p>Several long minutes passed, with only the sound of Rowan’s typing, feet shifting in the slowly rising water, adults murmuring to each other.</p>
         <p>“Why are we letting a kid try to fix this?”</p>
         <p>“Do you have any better ideas? None of us know the first thing about how this damn network works.”</p>
         <p>Rowan suddenly pointed at the screen.</p>
         <p>“The drainage system is stuck in an infinite processing loop in Sectors A, B, and K.”</p>
         <p>The first adult, the one who’d looked so befuddled at the computer in the first place, spoke tentatively. “Can you fix it?”</p>
         <p>Rowan slammed the enter key. “Just did, I think.”</p>
         <p>He looked back at the adults around him. “We can’t keep letting Terrence do all the network upkeep himself. You all knew this would happen eventually.”</p>
         <p>The water level had already lowered from over my ankles to just my feet.</p>
         <p>“There’s so much to do on the station,” one of the adults whispered. “How were we supposed to find time to learn the network on top of that?”</p>
         <p>Rowan rolled his eyes again. Then he took my hand, and we walked away from the crowd of gawking grown-ups.</p>
         <p>“Where are we going?” I asked, dimly hoping the answer was “back to the janitorial closet,” so we could finish what we started earlier.</p>
         <p>“To the captain. If we keep putting one or two people in charge of vital station system upkeep, this is only going to keep happening. I figured out the problem this time, but we might not be lucky next disaster. I’m going to force Terrence to teach me everything he knows.”</p>
         <p>Rowan’s hand squeezed mine firmly. I sighed. It’d be a while before we had another chance to be together that way. Rowan’s mind was everywhere on the station at once, everywhere but in the quiet dark with my body in his arms.</p>
         <p>I smiled, and squeezed his hand back. That was one of the things I liked about him, after all.</p>

      <div class="userstuff">
         <p>“Alright, Liz. It’s finally time for the first experiment. You’re writing this down?”</p>
         <p>“Yes, ma’am,” replied the short mousy girl in the corner of the lab. She sat at a small table, diligently recording Dr. Emery’s words. A faint candle on the desk gave Liz just enough light to write.</p>
         <p>The doctor stood in the center of the room, overlooking a pentagram scrawled on the floor in white chalk. More candles lined the circumference of the sigil, casting her face in thick shadow. A sledgehammer laid on the floor next to her. Liz still wasn’t entirely sure what that was for.</p>
         <p>Laying atop the symbol was the shape of a young woman. It wasn’t actually a woman of course — Liz had watched the doctor carefully prepare the golem this past month, diligently recording her dictation the whole time.</p>
         <p>“And to think, my father wanted me run his<i> stationery store.</i> Ha!” She knelt down and held her hand over the light-brown sculpture. “I suppose I do have to thank him. If it weren’t for his teaching, I wouldn’t have discovered the best possible conduit for artificial life. Not mud or sand as the ancients thought. No, the wood chips my father pulps for his papermaking are a far more suitable medium for constructing my new daughter. The secret to artificial life was obviously to start with organic materials!”</p>
         <p>Liz had heard this spiel many times. She straightened up when the doctor finally stood.</p>
         <p>“Alright. Let’s begin.”</p>
         <p>The doctor chanted an incantation. The candle light flickered in the darkness. Supposedly, she was working to summon a soul from the ethereal plane to inhabit her wooden creation.</p>
         <p>Liz herself wasn’t convinced the doctor had any idea what she was doing. But the pay was good, and Liz was a professional.</p>
         <p>Dr. Emery finished her incantation.</p>
         <p>A cold wind blew through the room. The candles flickered, then snuffed out.</p>
         <p>There was a sudden terrible screaming, as if a woman was being tortured. Liz hurried to relight her candle.</p>
         <p>“Shit.” Emery’s voice rang out over the cacophony.</p>
         <p>There was a sudden loud thudding squelching sound. The screaming stopped.</p>
         <p>Liz struck her match. The doctor stood before her, sledgehammer still in hand. She’d crushed the golem’s head.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>“Alright Liz. Experiment number two. I realized where I went wrong the last time. I’d reversed the flow of her nervous system. When the golem awoke, it was like every nerve in her body was on fire.”</p>
         <p>Liz gulped. It had been three weeks since the last experiment. She hadn’t been looking forward to this.</p>
         <p>“This time will be different. I got it right this time.”</p>
         <p>The doctor started chanting. Once again, the lights flickered. Once again, a cold wind blew through the room. Liz shielded her candle this time, and it didn’t go out.</p>
         <p>A faint blue light appeared in the chest of golem, then vanished. The doctor waited.</p>
         <p>The golem slowly stood from the floor. Emery grinned from ear to ear, and started walking towards it.</p>
         <p>“My daughter. It’s so good to finally—”</p>
         <p>The golem opened its mouth and doubled over, retching. A flood of pulpy water erupted from its maw, splashing across the doctor’s lab coat and shoes.</p>
         <p>Then it keeled over and shattered into dozens of pieces.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>“Alright, Liz. Experiment number six. I know I got it right this time. We’ve eliminated all the imperfections in my design. Soon we will behold the perfect life-form — soon we shall be as gods!”</p>
         <p>Chanting. Lights flickered. Cold wind.</p>
         <p>The golem slowly stood.</p>
         <p>It opened its mouth. A stilted voice croaked and creaked through the room.</p>
         <p>“Did. You. Create. Me.”</p>
         <p>It was the first time any of the golems had spoken. Dr. Emery was delighted.</p>
         <p>“Yes! Please, call me—”</p>
         <p>The doctor’s voice cut off as the creature lurched forward and wrapped its hands around her throat.</p>
         <p>“Ack—! Liz!” The doctor squeezed some choked sobs out. “Help!”</p>
         <p>But Liz was already grabbing the sledgehammer. She’d learned her lesson after experiment four.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>“Experiment fourteen.” The doctor sounded as tired and beaten down as Liz felt. “This one will work.”</p>
         <p>They performed the ritual. A soul entered the golem, as always.</p>
         <p>The creature’s eyelids fluttered open. The doctor’s breathing hitched.</p>
         <p>It sat up in place, staring at the doctor and then at Liz.</p>
         <p>Its voice was soft, high, and quiet. “Who am I?”</p>
         <p>The doctor composed herself. “You are my creation. My… my child.”</p>
         <p>“You’re my mother?”</p>
         <p>The doctor managed a smile. None of the others had gotten this far before.</p>
         <p>“Yes. I’m your mother.”</p>
         <p>“I see.” The creature cocked her head. “Mother. Can you help me go back to the other place? I liked it better there.”</p>
         <p>“What? No, sweetie. You belong here, with me.”</p>
         <p>The creature recoiled. “I don’t want that.”</p>
         <p>The doctor stepped towards her, opening her arms to give her a hug.</p>
         <p>The creature stood. “I’m going back. I’m going back!”</p>
         <p>She ran away from the doctor — straight towards the stone wall. She slammed into it head first. An explosion of tiny wood shards flew around the room, some of them colliding with Liz's goggles. She was thankful she'd started wearing them five experiments ago.</p>
         <p align="center">* * *</p>
         <p>“OKAY!” The doctor had a crazed look in her eye. She had to yell over the din of the lab. “I think I’ve figured out the flaws in the last batch, and corrected them for experiments eighty-five, eighty-six, and eight-seven. Though I’m still holding out hope for experiments sixty-eight, seventy, and seventy-four.”</p>
         <p>She gestured towards the golems bound tightly in cages lining the wall, the ones who’d been screaming into their gags non-stop at least since Liz had started her shift. “With a little more reeducation, I should be able to stop them from instinctively destroying themselves the second they get free.”</p>
         <p>Dr. Emery waved her arms around and gesticulated vaguely at the three bound-up golems in three pentagrams around the room. “But! These shouldn’t need any reeducation at all. At least one of them shouldn’t. Probably.”</p>
         <p>The doctor performed the ritual.</p>
         <p>Three more agonized screams instantly joined the others. Liz and the doctor both covered their ears.</p>
         <p>One of the golems tore its restraints. Within seconds, it had grabbed the sledgehammer and crushed the head and chest of the other two. The doctor ran forward and wrestled with it for a moment. It managed to push her off. Then it got on its knees and smashed its own head against the floor.</p>
         <p>Dr. Emery sat in silence for a while. Then she stood, gathered her notes, and left for her atelier, no doubt to start work on her next batch.</p>
         <p>Liz adjusted her goggles. She was seriously considering looking for other work.</p>

      <h2 id="shadows-weave" class="toc-heading">The Shadows' Weave</h2> <a href="#header">↑</a>
      <div class="userstuff">
         <p>
            A white shadow floated around a pin-point of light. They were only getting one chance at this. She wanted to get it just right. 
         </p>
         <p>
            When the shadow looked at the tiny light, she saw the result of countless eons of study. Their mathematics were precise enough to account for any and all possibilities — but complex enough to produce the kind of beauty she desired. She pulled on a nanometer-thick strand of luminescence and threaded it around another, forming another stitch in the impossibly dense weave they’d been crafting. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Another, darker shadow floated around her. He’d been rushing the white shadow, wanting desperately to see their light bloom. He told her it was ridiculous to try to manage every conceivable possibility. They’d created the light, and what happened when they set it free would happen. All this endless tweaking wouldn’t accomplish anything. 
         </p>
         <p>
            The first shadow looked up just long enough to tell the other to either make himself useful or buzz off. They had all the time in existence — they 
            <em>
            were
            </em>
            existence, after all. There was no reason to move forward until they were absolutely ready. 
         </p>
         <p>
            The second shadow scoffed. He started talking about all the beauty in store for them. He spoke of massive novas of bursting hydrogen and helium, the birth and expansion and death of stars, gravity wells growing so deep and dense that even light couldn’t escape their pull. 
         </p>
         <p>
            A third shadow appeared, brushing him off. Of course it would be beautiful, she said. That was all the more reason to get it just right. If their numbers were off by the slightest fraction, if the pull of gravity or the speed of light wasn’t exactly as it should be, all their stars could vanish into formless seas of atoms. They’d have none of the beauty they sought. 
         </p>
         <p>
            A fourth shadow bickered with this one. Wouldn’t the formless seas be pleasing too, in their own way? Whatever their light produced, she insisted, would be worth admiring. There was no reason to keep fretting and tinkering. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Other shadows burst out of the firmament to argue. One spoke of stars gathering into vast spiraling clusters, huge arms of light twisting and dancing in the darkness. One spoke of great balls of gas orbiting the stars, too small for the fusion necessary to birth light themselves, but with unique, exquisite patterns of color on their surface for them to admire. One spoke of great formations of rock and sediment, how the heat at the core of these formations would create bursting veins of magma. One spoke of the most minute of chemical reactions, atoms grappling with each other and merging with each other and tearing each other apart. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Countless shadows circled the light, many of them adding new stitches to the weave, all working toward the future they wished for for their light. Coronas of plasma erupting into space, spectrums of color, belts of asteroids, cosmic rays, radioactive half-lives, meteors and moons, tidal waves and eclipses. 
         </p>
         <p>
            They’d had an eternity to consider what they wanted from the light, and that eternity had split them apart into an infinity of quarreling fragments, all working for and against each other to create the future they wanted. 
         </p>
         <p>
            One little shadow ignored the others. She tightened one last stitch in her part of the weave. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Her dream for the light was a small one, just a tiny part of the greater piece all the others were working on. Riboplasms and lysosomes, DNA and mitochondria. She had a vision for what a cell should look like, how it would work, what starting conditions for the light would allow it to eventually exist.
         </p>
         <p>
            It was a complex task, and she didn’t have any help. She’d tried in the past to convince the other fragments of their whole to take an interest in her vision, but she’d never won any of them over. Over time, the strain of their countless competing dreams had torn them apart into the mess they were now. 
         </p>
         <p>
            But it didn’t matter. She watched every new stitch the other shadows made to the light. If an adjustment was required to allow for what she wanted, she made it. She knew what her cells were capable of, how they could grow, split, evolve. She desperately wanted to see what they would do. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Most importantly — unlike her — the cells were finite. Maybe that meant they could avoid the pain of the fragmentation that plagued their whole, how eons of working and consorting among only themselves had splintered them more and more. 
         </p>
         <p>
            She tightened and cut her stitch, shutting out the cacophony around her. To live as one and to die as one. She couldn’t think of a greater gift for her infinitesimally small piece of their vast creation.
