				<p>I've been regularly <a href="https://farawaytimes.itch.io/">releasing
				free games
					online</a> since 2013! My work's been featured on many sites over the years, including PCGamer, Indiegames.com, and FreeIndieGam.es.</p>
				<p>My blog post
					<a href="https://farawaytimes.blogspot.com/2023/02/how-to-make-good-small-games.html">How To Make Good Small Games</a>
					was a viral hit in early 2023. It was featured on Critical Distance and the front page of Hacker News.
				</p>
				<p>I was interviewed by Edwin Evans-Thirlwell for PCGamer as part of
					<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-micro-rpgs-offering-new-perspectives-on-the-genres-overstuffed-epics/">a piece on Micro-RPGs</a>, small-scale RPGs (often released by hobbyists) that offer an alternative perspective on what the genre can look like.
				</p>
				<p>I organized the chain game anthology
					<a href="https://vextro.itch.io/gardens-of-vextro">Gardens of Vextro</a>
					in 2022.
				</p>
				<p>I've been an advocate online of small-scale hobbyist game development for years. I enjoy analyzing games as an expressive storytelling medium. I think mainstream games criticism focuses too much on length and production values, and that wonderful stories are too often dismissed because they don't look expensive or technically complex enough.
